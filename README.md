> A quick way to setup your commit signature to be conformant with contributing guidelines of a project

## Description

Currently only supports one type of signature, but if other projects like this approach or we have users that have different signatures they have to set up on their github hooks for different projects, we can add a feature to select the signature through a CLI argument.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm i -g sign-commit
$ sign-commit
done
```
